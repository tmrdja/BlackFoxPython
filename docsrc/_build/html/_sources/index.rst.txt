Black Fox documentation
=======================

**The goal of Black Fox is to dramatically simplify
the process of building deployment-ready predictive models.**

Black Fox is a cloud-based “one click data-in model-out” 
**robust artificial intelligence software solution** for automated 
generation of the most adequate predictive model for any given dataset. 
It optimizes all parameters and hyperparameters of 
neural networks by genetic algorithm.
Optimization targets include number of hidden layers, 
number of neurons per layer, 
activation functions, dropout, learning algorithms, etc.
During an evolutionary process, Black Fox automatically performs adjustments of NN architecture according to the present dataset.
